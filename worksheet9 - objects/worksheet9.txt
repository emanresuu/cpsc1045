(1) What is a literal object?

A literal object is defined using JavaScript object notation, rather 
than a constructor. 
A literal object is defined using values in their most concrete form. 

(2) What is a constructor?

A constructor is a series of instructions designed to automate the 
process of creating objects.

(3) Explain the keyword 'this'.

'this' is a keyword that is used in a constructor to attaches methods or 
parameters to an object that is being defined.

(4) How can you store an object in an array?

Objects can be stored the same way regardless of data type. The code below 
defines an object and an array, then adds the object to the array. 

var someObject = {};
var someArray = [];
someArray.push(someObject);

(5) Write a constructor for the following object:

function createPet(name, species, breed, allergies) {
   "use strict";
   this.name = name;
   this.species = species;
   this.breed = breed;
   this.allergies = allergies; 
}
