1) What is an event on an HTML page. 

An event on an HTML page is any user action that the page could 
respond to.

2) On which HTML tag do we place the onload attribute?

We place the onload attribute in the body tag.

3) How do you add an event handler to a button? What is one of the 
attributes you can use?

I add an event handler to a button by adding a DOM event attribute 
to an input tag.

One of the attributes that I can use is onclick.

4) When writing event driven programs, all your code should be in 
functions. How do these functions share information with each other?

In an event driven program, where all code should be in functions, 
functions share information with each other by way of global variables.

5) In the example below, what is displayed inside the button and what 
happens when the button is pressed? Why does count need to be a global 
variable?

In the example, button1 is displayed inside the button.

The first time that the button is pressed the function 'buttonHandler' 
displays 'You pressed the button 1 times." Each subsequent time the 
button is pressed the number in the message increases by 1.  

The variable 'count' needs to be a global variable because its value 
needs to be preserved after 'buttonHandler' has finished running.  

6) Write a simple web-app, that has a button, input text field on the 
page and output div. When the user clicks the button, put the reverse 
of whatever the user has in the input text field into the output div.

   var stringLength = string.length;
   var i;
   var stringBuilder = "";
   for (i = 0; i < stringLength; i = i + 1) {
      stringBuilder = string.substring(i , i + 1) + stringBuilder; 
   }
   var output = document.getElementById("out");
   output.innerHTML = stringBuilder;
}
