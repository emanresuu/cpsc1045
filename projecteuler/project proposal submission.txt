This project is a collection of my solutions to Project Euler problems that
have been squirreled into the mind of a narcisstic, depricating, and painfully 
conceited chatbot.


The chatbot:

   solicits user input in the correct form

   replies with text

   replies with graphics

   does not repeat Itself

   interrupts you as you are typing


Here is a Project Euler problem of 5% difficulty:

   Multiples of 3 and 5
   Problem 1 

   If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 
   5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

   Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


Here is a sample of the corresponding chatbot output:

   Chatbot: "Fascinating, you might be interested to know that I can find the 
   sum of the multiples of 3 and 5 less than any number. Give me a number and 
   I'll show you."

   Chatbot: Well, I didn't expect you to come up with an interesting number. 

   Chatbot: The solution is 123.
