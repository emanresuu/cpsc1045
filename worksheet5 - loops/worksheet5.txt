1) Why are loops used?

Loops are used instead of explicitly repeating code because they tend to be shorter.

2) Name two types of loops and why they are different. 

Two types of loops are for loops and while loops. 
For loops perform a known number of repetitions. 
While loops perform an unknown number of repetitions.

3) What does the following code do?

This code will do nothing because 'number()' was not previously define. If JavaScript was not a case sensitive language, this code would prompt the user for a non negative number until given.

4)For the following loop fill in the table below and state what it draws.

a   x   k
0   0   0
2   20  40

This code draws an upside down, increasing bar graph. All bars have width of 5. There is a space of 15 pixels between each bar. The height of bars from left to right are 0, 40, 80, 120, and 160.

5) Fill in the table below for the code below and state what it draws. 

xIdx   yIdx   xoffset   yoffset colour
 0      0        0           0
 1      1        10          10

This code draws a stairwell going down from left to right. It is made of blue square, all of the same size, attached to each other by their top-right and bottom-left corners. 

6) What is the value of stringTotal and s1 after the loop executes? How will stringTotal be displayed on an HTML page?

After the string executes s1 will have a value of ' **********' and stringTotal will have a value of:

"" + "*"  + "<br>" + 
     "**"  + "<br>" +
     "***"  + "<br>" +
     "****"  + "<br>" +
     "*****"  + "<br>" +
     "******"  + "<br>" +
     "*******"  + "<br>" +
     "********"  + "<br>" +
     "*********"  + "<br>" +
     "**********"  + "<br>"

stringTotal will be displayed on an HTML page as:


*
**
***
****
*****
******
*******
********
*********
**********
