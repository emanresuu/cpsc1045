1) What is an array?

An array is an object containing a series of elements. Each element
is given a unique index number. The index numbers can be used to call
and manipulate the elements

2) How do we change the value of an element in an array?

We change the value of an element in an array by assigning a new value
using the element's index number. e.g.

var anArray = [1, 2, 3];
anArray[0] = "green";
anArray; //-> ["green", 2, 3]
 
3) Which methods do we use to add an element to an array.

We use the push method and the method where we assign a value to a missing 
index.

4) What can an array hold? Can an array hold multiple types at once.

An array can hold each and every JavaScript data type in any combination
at any one time.

5) Given the following array: ... What is the value of result?

The value of result is "dogdeer".

6) Write a function that accepts an array as input and returns an array
of all the odd numbers stored in the input array. 

function getOdd(anArray) {
	"use strict";
	var oddArray = [];
	for (var i = 0; i < anArray.length; i = i + 1) {
		if (anArray[i] % 2 !== 0) {
			oddArray.push(anArray[i]);
		}
	}
	return oddArray;
}
